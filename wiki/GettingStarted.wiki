#summary Getting Started with Android

To get started with Android you have to:
  * Install Eclipse (more info on http://code.google.com/android/intro/index.html)
  * Install Android SDK (more info on http://code.google.com/android/intro/index.html)
  * Install Subversion Plugin for Eclipse (let me know if you could not find it)
