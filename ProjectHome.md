# Android Location #

Android Location (aka AL) is the social tool that instantly connects you to the people and places around you. Let your friends know what you are doing and where you are in real time from your mobile phone or computer!


**EXPLORE** what's happening in your area right now with live maps. Recommend places.

**CONNECT** with friends on the fly - find out what they are doing and where they are.

**BROADCAST** memorable moments as they happen by sharing videos and pictures from your mobile phone.


AL works on any computer and in most mobile phones, it do not require GPS to detect your current location
